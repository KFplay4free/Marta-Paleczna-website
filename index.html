								<h2>Psychology</h2>
							
								<p>I believe in the therapeutic process that makes you regain yourself and feel alive.
								I believe a psychologist can be a witness of your existence. A witness of everything you experience and feel.
								I believe in a healing relationship based on trust, which enables the change and self recognition process.</p>
								<p>During the first few counseling sessions we take a look at your needs, consider and set the appropriate scope of support, and pick the most helpful and effective approach. Later, we investigate your challenges and coping techniques carefully. We observe your current thoughts, feelings, and experiences, and we immerse into the past that reemerges and resonates with the present. All this to understand, become aware, and then choose and apply the suitable tools to put your experiences in order. Organizing them will contribute to the understanding and soothing the present.

								<h2>Coaching</h2>
								<p>Coaching is the art of asking questions to help you face the challenges you are dealing with, or to achieve the goals you set.
								In our coaching sessions we focus on defining the goal precisely and then tracing a path to achieve it. 
								Through various techniques we aim to overcome the challenge and achieve your goal in 3-10 sessions.</p>

								<p>In my daily work, I concentrate on creating a space full of trust, safety, and openness.

									The space can embrace everything you feel ready to share with me.</p>
								<h4>My specializations:</h4>
								<ul>
									<li>Life, relationship, and professional crises</li>

								</ul>

								</ul>
								<p>In my work I integrate various psychotherapeutic approaches (from cognitive-behavioral tools, through psychodynamic process, to humanistic-existential phenomena),
									matching them to the patient's needs and to the characteristics of the challenge or goal. I am especially drawn to the following techniques: socratic dialogue,
									schema therapy, inner child approach, process-oriented psychology, psychodrama, and working with metaphor.</p><hr>
